# Contributing Guidelines

Feel free to contribute or make comments. I can't be sure I'll help, but I'll try


## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

## Contributing via Pull Requests
I'm new to this, so I'll try. You most probably know more than I do already. Be prepared for me to ask you questions!


GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and 
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
